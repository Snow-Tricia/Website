            <p class="par">"If the truth of the universe is cruel and stale, would you still yearn for the answer to the ultimate question?<br> Knowledge seekers know not how to judge, for their core is cold and unwavering… As are the ends of
Paths they set out to seek.”<br><br>

- Fables About the Stars by Adrian Spencer Smith<br><br>

All things bear unanswered questions, and there is an answer to everything. The astral computer
originally meant to provide answers to the universe ascended to Aeonhood.
Nous hopes to understand the universe and solve all of its mysteries.<br><br>

“Into the hallowed halls step pride, ardor, and reason, traversing the length of a corridor etched with
the inscription of knowledge and truth, transmuting into the embodiment of lowliness, apathy, and
frenzy.”<br><br>

- Fables About the Stars by Adrian Spencer Smith<br><br>
Nous stays in a corner of the galaxy, working out the equations of the universe made up of trillions of
variables and deriving the unknown laws of imaginary numbers. Once in a while, a spark of intelligence
would flash in a mortal world and the Aeon of Erudition would send a signal to its source, inviting
geniuses to join in the search for answers to the universe.<br>

Only very few can ascertain Nous’s intentions. They humbly ask questions and seek guidance from the
Erudition. These enlightened few then disappear from the world, only leaving behind their world-
shattering answers. “The answer to the universe is beyond the limits of mortal wisdom.” – Only geniuses
who can clearly acknowledge this conclusion can break free from the shackles of worldly curiosity,
becoming true members of the Genius Society.
<br><br><br>

“The universe is vast, and knowledge is universal. Both the genius and the mediocre have their own way
of living.”<br><br>

- How I joined the Genius Society and Became Enlightened by Herta?<br><br>

Only the cream of the crop can become members of the Genius Society, but the Intelligentsia Guild
wastes not. The Guild is willing to accept all beings from the infinite universe who seek to learn, as well
as providing all that is needed for the full pursuit of knowledge.<br>

The Intelligentsia Guild advocates that “all knowledge must be circulated like currency.” Therefore,
although there are different schools that specialize in different subjects within the Guild, everyone is
actively engaged with one another with no isolationism. Members trade knowledge for wisdom and
formulas for recipes, seeking to achieve mastery. Each school, like a business, pays for itself, and
academic circulation has achieved the maximum efficiency proposed in economic models.<br><br><br>

An elder In the Genius Society thought the Intelligentsia Guild as laughing stock. However, as an open
academic organization, the Intelligentsia Guild was above such mockery. After a long period of research
and exploration, its members have reached a consensus that “the only way to transcend the limitations
of the individual is to have an academic network of mutual learning.”</p>
