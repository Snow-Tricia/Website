           <p class="par">There is a lot of debate in the Guild about whether Yaoshi is good or evil, and I think that's just people having too much time on their hands. Anyone with the slightest respect for the universe wouldn't apply our narrow definitions of good and evil to incomprehensible existences such as Aeons.<br><br><br> Personally, I have an open mind when it comes to Yaoshi - I will help the Xianzhou Alliance to sort out the Abominations of Abundance, but it won't stop me from genuinely admiring Yaoshi as a lonely and romantic existence.<br><br><br> They travel between the universes with The Hunt and the Alliance in hot pursuit, both of which have sworn to destroy them... And yet they continue to bring enlightenment to world after "world. I understand that the Abundance had never taken a single life, even though those they come into contact with often end up with a fate worse than death<br>

<p class="par">"The flowers share their petals without care, waiting for their inevitable withering destiny. The birds fly high in song, moving toward their inevitable crash and death. The streams flow rapidly with life, in a direction where they inevitably run dry. Why must all things come to an end? There must be a miracle somewhere in the universe that can cure the disease known as finality."<br><br>

Yaoshi is the nurturer of lives, the god of eternal paradise. Their desire is to ensure the perpetual existence of life. Yaoshi is an Aeon who answers all prayers and cannot bear to see death and the pains of illness.</p>
