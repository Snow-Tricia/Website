            <p class="par">Lan, on the other hand, often appears before mortals.<br> However, they move too fast, and very few observations have been made about their actual form.<br> Most of the reliable information is kept by the Xianzhou Alliance and it took me a great amount of effort to get.<br> As one of the rare factions in the universe that is completely.<br> blessed by an Aeon, the Alliance stands on equal grounds with the IPC, which meant the IPC couldn't help me at all.<br> In the end, Ruan Mei had to step up to help: In the ancient Xianzhou language, "Lan" means "an unpredictable for," and the Aeon's formal name in Xianzhou is Reignbow Arbiter.<br> According to Xianzhou natives, the Lux Arrow of The Hunt showed them the way as their civilization was about to fall.<br><br>
                 How would you describe the Aeon of The Hunt?<br><br> We can get an impression from the Xuange Observation Station's report in AE 2162. The astronomical observation system detected a gravitational wave, a spatial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured and covering astronomical distances. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky. leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. The bad news was the IPC lost a planet in its business sphere. The good news was the IPC was out of ideas regarding the molting disease (undoubtedly.the work of Yaoshi) spreading throughout Xuange. The light permanently "healed" that planet and the patients on it, a race of immortal half-human half-snake monsters. This is the action and creed of The Hunt, for whom salvation and destruction are nigh indistinguishable. Their perpetual enemy, the Abundance, is the same, for they bring healing and torment hand-in-hand. <br> “With no end to hate and no boundaries to war, how much concern do you shoulder? With determined
eyes and the arrow drawn, the Reignbow Arbiter needs not turn back hither.”<br>

- Worlds History as a Mirror, Xianzhou<br><br>
<p class="par">The Aeon known as the Reignbow Arbiter wanders endlessly between worlds to destroy the undead
beings that once poisoned their homeworld. The cost of the hunt was never a consideration for Lan.
There is often no difference between the salvation they offer and total destruction.<br><br>

“Fight together against countless enemies. Be together through endless turmoil. Of the thousand
lifespans encountered, I take but one sip and leave the rest to its fate.”<br><br>

- Worlds History as a Mirror, Xianzhou<br><br>
<p class="par">In an ancient era of legends, multiple Xianzhou ships were tasked with voyaging across the stars to
search for the miracle medicine of immortality.<br> The endless voyage took its toll on Xianzhou, wearing
away its conviction and shape over the long years, until their eventual encounter with Yaoshi.<br> However,
all that the fruit of immortality brought upon them were sorrows, poverty, and endless war and death. It
wasn’t until Lan, the Aeon of The Hunt, returned from the Abyss. Then, using gravity as bowstring and

stars as arrows, Lan shattered the Ambrosial Arbor in one strike and put the wickedness of the
Abundance to an end. After Xianzhou returned to the righteous path, it formed an alliance under the
guidance of The Hunt and formed a powerful army known as the Cloud Knights. The alliance’s goals
were to patrol the world and eradicate all Abominations of Abundance, and put an end to the
corruption of the undead.<br><br>

Over the years, the Xianzhou Alliance landed on a great number of worlds that used to enjoy the grace
of gods. They eradicated countless undead abominations. Any civilization that worshiped the Abundance
had to consider the possible threat of the Xianzhou destroying their planet. This kind of deterrence was
precisely what the Xianzhou Alliance is hoping to be. They want to be seen as the constant red line for
those greedy for immortality, becoming the price that none dares to pay.<br>

To this day, countless souls have gathered upon Xianzhou, all bearing the will of The Hunt and the intent
of seeking revenge on the ravaging Abundance.<br>
They will not rest until the complete eradication of the Deathless Doom, and their galactic tours will not
end.<br>

“The ultimate fighter dreams only of the stars.”<br><br>

Not all devotees of The Hunt hate the Abundance. Such a group of talented rangers exists out there. This
group admires Lan’s policy of using violence against violence and the Aeon’s swift decisiveness regarding
punishment, believing the benevolence and justice of the universe need to be upheld via personal
action.<br><br>

The Galaxy Rangers formed into a group of heroes, walking the Path of The Hunt, and roam the universe
thanks to the blessings of the Aeon. They went from planet to planet upholding justice for the locals,
hunting down evil, then embarking on new journeys.<br><br>



The successful assassination of a Lord Ravager, Zulo, first brought the Galaxy Rangers their fame. And
many years later, a Ranger thwarted the atavistic experiment of the 64 th member of the Genius Society,
Dr. Primitive. But after that, these Galaxy Rangers gradually faded out of sight in the galaxy. Rumor has it
that they fell victim to Dr. Primitive’s vengeance.</p>
