            <p class="par">Out of the dozen-or-so Aeons we already know, Terminus and Aha are odd, and Mythus and Fuli are mysterious. I am very interested in them. However, while IX the Nihility is both odd and mysterious, I just bring to be interested. Maybe it's because IX is too easy to read<br>
            <h2>IX the Nihility</h2><br>
            <p class="par">"You may gaze deep into the vast grandeur of the stars, but do not glance at the abyss of the void... for it holds nothing except for the ability to make mortals lose all reason and thought."<br> -Murong, Doctor of Chaos<br>The existence of Nihility is a mystery itself, their form enshrouded by layers of mist.<br> 
            IX doesn't interact with the other Aeons. They believe that the ultimate fate of the multiverse is nothingness, and therefore, worthless.</p>
