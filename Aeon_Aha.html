            <p class="par">The Elation, seriously?<br><br> I don't feel elated when I think about Aha. All I feel is chaos. No other Aeon is as much of a headache as Aha. Aha has no sense of self-consciousness, is utterly unpredictable, does everything on a whim, and plays mortals and the universe like a fiddle.<br> According to poor old Elias Salas' records, Aha once turned a Noblesse Worm into their Emanator and granted the worm fathomless intelligence, just to see if Noblesse Worms could enter the Genius Society The answer was no.<br><br> For this pointless experiment, the Elation gave the entirety of their Path's power to a worm that doesn't even have a fully developed brain, and then just discarded the creature once it had outlived its purpose. Without the Aeon's blessing, the worm died instantly and tragically. I don't know why Elias Salas recorded this in such great detail. Maybe he was shocked by this?<br> 

<h2>Aha<br><span> The Elation</span><br></h2>

<p class="par">"The Erudition is a hunk of junk, the Preservation is a blockhead. The Hunt has no sense of humor, and the Destruction is a lunatic. All the Aeons are as stubborn as they come. What a shame for Aha!"<br><br>

The elated one understands that only the wise and sentient possess the privilege of understanding joy. Neither the dusty rocks nor the distant stars can fathom the humor that life entails.<br>

A quest for formidable adversaries in games of strategy and activities to while away the time bears no winners or losers.<br>

Instead, a search for the kind of laughter that leaves one breathless, will lead to the unexpected delights that uplift the soul toward divinity.</p>
