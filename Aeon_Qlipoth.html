            <p class="par">Qlipoth the Preservation is the oldest known Aeon in the universe alongside Oroboros the Voracity. I was once very interested in Qlipoth, as the first two centuries in the Amber Era were almost completely blank. What creature is this giant rock/amber?<br> Where did they come from? How did they become an Aeon? And why are they tirelessly making a wall?<br><br> There are many questions surrounding them, but the answers are nowhere to be found. The IPC is doing too good of a job keeping Qlipoth's information a secret. These people regard the Amber Lord as the one true god and allow not even the smallest transgression towards the Aeon. I didn't get any useful information out of the IPC. In contrast, the Intelligentsia Guild has a lot less respect for the Preservation<br>

The builder of the Celestial Comet Wall, the Subspace Crystalline Barrier, and the Great Attractor Base. Followers call them the "Amber Lord," one of the oldest and most tenacious Aeons, having survived the "Dusk Wars." <br> After finding out a threat was imminent, the Amber Lord forged a powerful light-years-long seal that would isolate and protect the living worlds.</p>
